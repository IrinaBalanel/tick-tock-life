# Tick-Tock Life 

## Idea
The goal for this project is to create a 'useless' website with no real purpose other than to amuse viewers or distract them from reality for a short while. However, I decided to highlight the uselessness of these websites. 

This simple website emphasizes how much precious time a person spends on the website reading purposeless information instead of doing something meaningful and useful in life, while reinforcing the message about wasting precious time.

## Description

### Front-End:
The website involves HTML, CSS, JavaScript and includes the following features:
- Typing Text Looping Animation: a continuous animation displaying a message that loops endlessly, designed to keep the user engaged in reading.
- GIF Animation: an attention-grabbing GIF animation that emphasizes the time-wasting aspect and attracts the userâ€™s attention to the fact that they are wasting time.
- Timer: a visible timer that shows the exact amount of time a user has spent on the website.
- Audio: a sound of a clock ticking, which reinforces the impression of waisting time.
- Call-to-Action button: a user interaction which loads another content.
- Another GIF Animation with a sound of crowds cheering the user after the button is clicked.

### Back-End:
Initially, the site didn't require any data storage or back-end processing, as it purely served as a front-end demonstration but then I decided to integrate Open AI API to generate new messages, dynamically updating the front-end with this text.

### Additional Information:
Since the broweser don't allow playing audios and videos without user interacting with the site first, I assigned the audio play to the GIF animation of the clock, which can be heard only after the user clicks on it.
